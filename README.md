# [TidBit](https://harsh98trivedi.github.io/TidBit) — Notes & Reminders (Svelte)

TidBit is a minimalist, glassmorphic **notes & todo** app built with **Svelte + Vite**, designed as a personal, offline-friendly alternative to Google Keep.

You can create rich notes with formatting, tags, color labels and reminders — all stored locally in your browser.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for subtle animations
- [marked](https://marked.js.org/) for markdown rendering
- Plain old Web APIs:
  - `localStorage` for persistence
  - Notifications API for reminders
  - Service Worker for basic offline support

## 🌐 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This repo is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages at: [https://harsh98trivedi.github.io/TidBit/](https://harsh98trivedi.github.io/TidBit/)

### Key pieces:

Vite base path in vite.config.js is set to:

```
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { svelte } from "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [svelte()],
  base: "/TidBit/", // must match the repo name on GitHub
});
```

A GitHub Actions workflow (in .github/workflows/deploy.yml) does:

- npm ci
- npm run build
- Uploads dist as the Pages artifact
- Deploys to GitHub Pages

### One-time setup

1. Push the repo to GitHub as `harsh98trivedi/TidBit`.
2. In the repo:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Under Build and deployment, choose GitHub Actions.
3. Push to the `master` branch.
4. Wait for the Deploy TidBit to GitHub Pages workflow to complete.
5. After that, every push to `master` automatically updates:

## 🔔 Notifications & Permissions

- Notifications require HTTPS and user permission.
- GitHub Pages is HTTPS, so it works out of the box.
- Use the bell icon in the header to trigger a test notification:
  - If permission is not yet granted, the browser prompts you.
  - If notifications are blocked, you may need to allow them from site settings.

## .

🛠 Customization

- Branding: edit the app name, logo, and footer in `App.svelte`.
- Colors: tweak the `[data-color="..."]` CSS rules for card backgrounds.
- Animations: adjust or remove GSAP animations in App.svelte if you prefer a calmer UI.
- Markdown: change how markdown is rendered by adjusting the `renderHTML` helper and `marked` options.

## 🔒 Privacy

- TidBit is fully client-side:
  - No accounts, no backend.
  - All data lives in your browser’s storage (and optional service worker cache).
  - Clearing your browser data will permanently remove your notes.
